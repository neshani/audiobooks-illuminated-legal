## Privacy Policy for Audiobooks Illuminated

**Last Updated:** January 12, 2026

**1. Introduction**
Audiobooks Illuminated ("we," "our," or "the App") is a native Android application designed to play audiobook files stored locally on your device. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.

**2. Data Collection and Usage**

**2.1 General Usage (Offline)**
For standard playback functionality, Audiobooks Illuminated operates as an offline application.
*   **Your Audio Files:** We do not upload, sync, or backup your audio files to any cloud server. Your library remains strictly on your device.
*   **Personal Information:** We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or location data.

**2.2 The "Illumination" Shortcode Feature**
The App includes an optional feature allowing you to download curated artwork packs ("Illuminations") using a "Shortcode."
*   **Data Transmitted:** When you enter a shortcode, the App generates a cryptographic hash (a digital fingerprint) based on the file structure and duration of the audiobook you are currently viewing. This hash is sent to our server to identify the correct Illumination pack(s).
*   **Purpose:** This data is used solely to match your local book with the correct visual content from our repository.
*   **Anonymity:** This hash cannot be reversed to reveal your original filenames. We do not link this hash to your personal identity or device ID.

**3. App Permissions**

The App requires specific permissions to function on Android:
*   **Storage Access (Read/Write):** Required to read your audiobook files and save downloaded Illumination packs (`illuminations.zip`) to the specific book folder. We adhere to the "Source of Truth" principle: we never rename, move, or delete your original audio files.
*   **Network Access:** Required only to download Illumination packs or books when explicitly initiated by you.
*   **Notifications:** Required for displaying the notification player and for background downloads from the web or desktop apps.

**4. Third-Party Services**
The App is distributed via the Google Play Store. Google may collect usage statistics and crash reports in accordance with the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

**5. Changes to This Policy**
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
